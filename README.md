# Diabeties Predictive Model
Our goal is to make a predictive model to predict if an individual has diabeties or not based on 9 related factors.

Our project is creating multiple predictive models on R-studio through Random Forest, Logarithmic, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) Models. Our goal is to understand how each factor relates to diabeties as a whole, and figure out which model has the highest sensitivty and specificity to predict diabeties accurately. Our 8 factors we're focusing on are: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabeties Pedigree Function , Age, with the last factor being the outcome (1 = has diabeties, 2 = no diabeties). Currently, our data set is from a subset of individuals, specifically: Female, Indian Heritage, 21 or older. WE hope to use this model to expand our subset of the data set, in order to make predictions for greater groups of individuals.
